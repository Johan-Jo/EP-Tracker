-- PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION MIGRATION
-- ============================================================================
-- This migration adds compound indexes and optimizes queries for better performance
-- Focuses on the project summary endpoint which makes multiple queries

-- ============================================================================
-- 1. COMPOUND INDEXES FOR COMMON QUERY PATTERNS
-- ============================================================================

-- time_entries: Frequently filtered by project_id and grouped by user_id
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_time_entries_project_user 
ON time_entries(project_id, user_id) 
WHERE status != 'rejected';

-- time_entries: Frequently filtered by project_id and grouped by phase_id
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_time_entries_project_phase 
ON time_entries(project_id, phase_id) 
WHERE status != 'rejected';

-- time_entries: Missing phase_id index for joins
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_time_entries_phase_id 
ON time_entries(phase_id);

-- memberships: Frequently filtered by org_id and looked up by user_id
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_memberships_org_user 
ON memberships(org_id, user_id) 
WHERE is_active = true;

-- materials: Often filtered by project and status
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_materials_project_status 
ON materials(project_id, status);

-- expenses: Often filtered by project and status
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_expenses_project_status 
ON expenses(project_id, status);

-- mileage: Often filtered by project and status
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_mileage_project_status 
ON mileage(project_id, status);

-- project_members: Speed up joins with profiles
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_project_members_user_project 
ON project_members(user_id, project_id);

-- ============================================================================

-- Add partial indexes for commonly queried statuses

-- 4. ANALYZE TABLES
-- ============================================================================
-- Update table statistics for query planner
