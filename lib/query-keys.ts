/**
 * Query Keys Structure for React Query
 * 
 * PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION (Story 26.1):
 * Centralized query keys for consistent caching and invalidation
 * 
 * Usage:
 * - Use these keys for all useQuery and useMutation hooks
 * - Keys are hierarchical for easy invalidation
 * - Type-safe with TypeScript
