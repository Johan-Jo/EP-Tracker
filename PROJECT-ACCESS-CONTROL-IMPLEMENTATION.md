# Project-Level Access Control Implementation

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive project-level access control to ensure users only see data for projects they're assigned to.

## Database Changes

### New Table: `project_members`
```sql
CREATE TABLE project_members (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    project_id UUID REFERENCES projects(id),
    user_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
    assigned_by UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
    UNIQUE(project_id, user_id)
);
```

### New RLS Helper Functions
- `is_project_member(project_uuid)` - Check if user is assigned to project
- `can_access_project(project_uuid)` - Check if user can access project (worker=assigned only, foreman/admin=all)
- `user_projects()` - Get all accessible project IDs for current user

### Updated RLS Policies
All project-related tables now respect project assignments:
- ✅ **projects** - Users only see assigned projects
- ✅ **phases** - Must have access to parent project
- ✅ **work_orders** - Must have access to parent project
- ✅ **time_entries** - Can only create/view for accessible projects
- ✅ **materials** - Can only create/view for accessible projects
- ✅ **expenses** - Can only create/view for accessible projects
- ✅ **mileage** - Can only create/view for accessible projects
- ✅ **ata** - Must have access to parent project
- ✅ **diary_entries** - Must have access to parent project
- ✅ **checklists** - Must have access to parent project

## Access Control Rules

### Role-Based Access
1. **Workers**: Only see projects they're explicitly assigned to
2. **Foremen**: See all projects in their organization
3. **Admins**: See all projects in their organization

### Migration Strategy
- All existing workers were automatically assigned to all projects in their organization
- This ensures no data access is lost during migration
- New workers must be explicitly assigned to projects

## API Endpoints

### Project Members Management
- `GET /api/projects/[id]/members` - Get all members of a project
- `POST /api/projects/[id]/members` - Add user to project
- `DELETE /api/projects/[id]/members?user_id=xxx` - Remove user from project

### Organization Members
- `GET /api/organizations/members` - Get all members in user's organization

## UI Components

### ManageTeamDialog
- Dialog for managing project team members
- Add/remove workers from projects
- Shows all current project members
- Only available to foremen and admins

**Location**: `components/projects/manage-team-dialog.tsx`

**Usage**:
```tsx
<ManageTeamDialog
  projectId={project.id}
  projectName={project.name}
  open={showDialog}
  onOpenChange={setShowDialog}
/>
```

## Security Benefits

### Before
- ❌ Any user in organization could see ALL projects
- ❌ Workers could see data from projects they shouldn't access
- ❌ No way to restrict project visibility

### After
- ✅ Workers only see their assigned projects
- ✅ Granular project-level access control
- ✅ Admins/Foremen can manage project assignments
- ✅ All data queries respect project access

## Migration File
`supabase/migrations/20241024000003_add_project_members.sql`

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Worker can only see assigned projects
- [ ] Foreman can see all projects in org
- [ ] Admin can see all projects in org
- [ ] Worker cannot create time entries for unassigned projects
- [ ] Foreman can add/remove project members
- [ ] Admin can add/remove project members
- [ ] Project list filters correctly by access
- [ ] Dashboard shows only accessible project data

## Future Enhancements

1. **Bulk Assignment**: Assign multiple users to project at once
2. **Project Roles**: Add project-specific roles (lead, member, viewer)
3. **Assignment History**: Track when users were added/removed
4. **Notification**: Notify users when assigned to new projects
5. **Self-Request**: Allow users to request access to projects

## Notes

- Migration auto-assigns all existing workers to all projects (backward compatible)
- Admins and foremen always have access to all org projects
- RLS policies handle all access control at database level
- No application-level filtering needed - database enforces rules
