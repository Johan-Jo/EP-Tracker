# 📸 Camera Capture Feature Added

## Overview

Added camera capture functionality to all photo upload components in EP-Tracker. Users can now **take photos directly with their phone camera** in addition to selecting existing files.

---

## ✅ What Was Changed

### Components Updated (3 files)

1. **`components/diary/diary-form.tsx`**
   - ✅ Added `capture="environment"` attribute
   - ✅ Updated text: "Ta foto eller välj fil" (Take photo or choose file)

2. **`components/diary/diary-form-new.tsx`**
   - ✅ Added `capture="environment"` attribute  
   - ✅ Updated text: "Ta foto eller välj fil" (Take photo or choose file)

### Components Already Had Camera Support ✅

5. **`components/expenses/expense-form.tsx`** - Already had `capture="environment"`
6. **`components/materials/receipt-upload.tsx`** - Already had separate camera input

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### Technical Implementation

The HTML5 `capture` attribute enables direct camera access on mobile devices:

```html
<input
  type="file"
  accept="image/*"
  capture="environment"  ← Opens rear camera on mobile
  multiple
  onChange={handlePhotoChange}
/>
```

### User Experience

#### On Mobile Devices (iOS/Android)
When user taps the upload area:
1. **Option 1:** Take photo with camera (opens camera app)
2. **Option 2:** Choose from photo library

#### On Desktop
Standard file picker opens (camera option not available)

### `capture` Attribute Values
- `capture="environment"` - Opens rear (back) camera (preferred for documents/receipts)
- `capture="user"` - Opens front (selfie) camera
- No capture attribute - File picker only

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Camera doesn't open on mobile

**Possible causes:**
1. Browser doesn't have camera permission
2. PWA needs to be reinstalled
3. Old browser version

**Solution:**
- Grant camera permission in browser settings
- Clear cache and reload
- Update browser to latest version

### Issue: "Take Photo" option not showing

**Check:**
- Using a mobile device? (Desktop doesn't show camera option)
- Browser supports capture attribute? (All modern mobile browsers do)
- Camera permission granted?
