## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If Buckets Are Missing

Some Supabase instances require buckets to be created via Dashboard:

1. **Go to:** Storage ‚Üí New Bucket
2. **Create each missing bucket:**
   
   **For receipts, diary-photos, ata-photos:**
   - Name: `[bucket-name]`
   - Public: ‚úì **Enable**
   - File size limit: 10 MB
   - Allowed MIME types: image/jpeg, image/jpg, image/png, image/webp, image/heic
   
   **For voice-recordings:**
   - Name: `voice-recordings`
   - Public: ‚úó **Disable** (Private)
   - File size limit: 10 MB
   - Allowed MIME types: audio/webm, audio/wav, audio/mpeg

3. **Then re-run** `scripts/fix-all-storage-buckets.sql` to add policies

## ‚úÖ Success Indicators

You'll know everything is working when:
- ‚úÖ Verification query shows all 4 buckets
- ‚úÖ Verification query shows 16 policies

## üìä What to Report Back

Please share:
