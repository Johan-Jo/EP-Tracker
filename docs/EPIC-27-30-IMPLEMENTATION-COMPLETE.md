## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions

### Database Strategy
‚úÖ **Extended `diary_entries`** instead of creating new `daybook_entries` table
- Reuses existing UI and queries
- Maintains data consistency
- Simpler data model

### Real-time Communication
‚úÖ **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** instead of WebSockets
- Compatible with Vercel Edge Runtime
- Simpler implementation for one-way streaming
- No need for WebSocket infrastructure

### Audio Processing Flow
```
1. User records ‚Üí MediaRecorder ‚Üí audio blob
2. POST /api/voice/upload ‚Üí Supabase Storage + session created
3. Connect to GET /api/voice/stream?sessionId=X (SSE)
4. Server downloads audio ‚Üí Whisper ASR ‚Üí GPT-4o Translation
5. Stream events: start ‚Üí transcription ‚Üí translation ‚Üí complete
6. Client receives voiceLogId + translated text
7. User can save to diary entry
```

## üîë Key Features Implemented

### Multi-Language Support
- Auto-detection or manual selection
- 10+ languages: Swedish, English, Polish, German, Spanish, Finnish, Norwegian, Arabic, Ukrainian, etc.
- Construction-specific glossary for accurate translations

### Real-time Progress
- SSE streaming for live updates
- Progress indicators for each processing step
- Live captions during processing

### Offline-First
- Audio recordings stored in IndexedDB
- Sync queue for background upload
- Works without internet connection

### Security & Access Control

---

## üìã Next Steps

### 1. Environment Setup
Add to `.env.local`:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

### 2. Database Migration
```bash
# Apply migration
npx supabase db push

# Or via SQL editor in Supabase Dashboard
# Run: supabase/migrations/20251029000001_voice_notes_foundation.sql
```

### 3. Storage Bucket Setup
```bash
# Create voice-recordings bucket in Supabase Dashboard
# Settings:
# - Name: voice-recordings
# - Public: false
# - File size limit: 25MB
# - Allowed MIME types: audio/webm, audio/ogg, audio/wav, audio/mp4
```

### 4. Testing Checklist

#### Unit Tests Needed
- [ ] Voice processing utilities (Whisper, Translation, Glossary)
- [ ] VAD functionality
- [ ] SSE client connection and event handling

#### Integration Tests Needed
- [ ] Upload ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Database flow
- [ ] SSE streaming with real audio file
- [ ] Diary entry creation from voice log

#### E2E Tests (Playwright)
- [ ] Record voice note in diary form
- [ ] Language selection
- [ ] Live captions display
- [ ] Save to diary entry
- [ ] Offline recording and sync

### 5. Manual Testing Flow
```bash
# 1. Start dev server
npm run dev

# 2. Navigate to: /dashboard/diary/new

# 3. Test voice recording:
# - Click "R√∂stanteckning" button
# - Select language (or auto-detect)
# - Click microphone to start recording
# - Speak: "Idag gj√∂t vi betong f√∂r fundament"
# - Click stop button
# - Wait for processing (SSE events)
# - Verify transcription and translation appear
# - Verify "Utf√∂rt arbete" field is populated
# - Save diary entry

# 4. Verify in database:
# - Check voice_logs table
# - Check diary_entries (voice_log_id should be set)
# - Check Supabase Storage (audio file uploaded)
```

## üêõ Known Limitations (MVP)

1. **No segment-level editing** - Can't edit individual sentences
2. **No audio playback** - Can't replay recording in UI (file is stored)
3. **No offline sync UI** - Background sync happens silently
4. **No re-translation** - Can't change target language after processing
5. **No batch processing** - One recording at a time

---

## üìä Testing Priorities

### High Priority (Must Test)
1. ‚úÖ Voice recording ‚Üí upload ‚Üí processing ‚Üí diary entry (happy path)
2. ‚úÖ Error handling (microphone denied, upload failed, API error)
3. ‚úÖ Multi-language support (Polish, English, Arabic)
4. ‚úÖ RLS policies (user isolation, admin access)

### Medium Priority (Should Test)
1. Long recordings (10+ minutes)
2. Poor audio quality
3. Network interruption during upload
4. Concurrent recordings (multiple users)

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)
1. Offline recording and sync
2. Browser compatibility (Safari, Firefox)
3. Mobile PWA voice recording
4. Background noise handling

## üéì Developer Notes

### File Naming Conventions
- `voice-*.ts` - Voice processing utilities
- `*-voice.ts` - Voice-specific variants of existing modules
- `components/voice/` - Voice UI components

### API Route Patterns
- `/api/voice/upload` - Node.js runtime (file upload)
- `/api/voice/stream` - Edge runtime (SSE streaming)
- `/api/diary/voice` - Voice-specific diary operations

### State Management
- Zustand store for recording state
- React Query for API queries (diary entries)
- IndexedDB for offline persistence
