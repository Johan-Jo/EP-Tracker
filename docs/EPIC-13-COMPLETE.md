### Trend Indicators
- ⬆️ **Up Arrow (Green):** Positive growth

---

## 🔐 Performance Optimizations

### Data Fetching
- **Parallel Queries:** All metrics fetched simultaneously
- **Single API Endpoint:** `/api/super-admin/metrics/dashboard`
- **Promise.all():** Reduces load time
- **Efficient Queries:** Count-only where possible

### Caching Strategy (Future)
- Metrics can be cached for 5-10 minutes
- Activity feed: Real-time or 1-minute cache
- System health: 30-second cache

### Database Optimization
- **Count queries** instead of full data fetches
- **Limited result sets** (e.g., top 10 activities)
- **Indexed columns** on timestamps, status

---

## 📊 Metrics Calculation Logic

### MRR Calculation
```typescript
// For each active subscription:
if (billing_cycle === 'monthly') {
  mrr += price_sek;
} else if (billing_cycle === 'annual') {
  mrr += price_sek / 12;  // Convert to monthly
}

arr = mrr * 12;
arpu = mrr / paying_customers;
```

### Churn Rate
```typescript
// Organizations that canceled in last 30 days
churn_rate = (canceled_count / total_customers) * 100
```

### Growth Rate
```typescript
// Month-over-month growth
growth_rate = ((this_month - last_month) / last_month) * 100
```

### Activity Feed
- Queries last 7 days of events
- Aggregates from multiple tables:
  - `organizations` (new signups)
  - `subscriptions` (new subscriptions)
  - `payment_transactions` (payments)
- Sorts by timestamp (newest first)
- Limits to 15-20 events
