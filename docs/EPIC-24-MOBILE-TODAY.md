## Offline Strategy

**Queue Mechanism:**
1. Check-in/out attempt while offline
2. Save to IndexedDB mobile_checkins table
3. Show optimistic update in UI
4. When online, sync manager processes queue
5. POST to /api/mobile/checkins
6. Mark as synced on success
7. Revert UI on error

**Idempotency:**
- Server checks for duplicate check-ins within 1 minute
- Returns success if duplicate (safe to retry)
- Prevents double check-ins from sync retries

## Out of Scope (Future Enhancements)

‚ùå Time entry from mobile (link to /dashboard/time instead)  
‚ùå Materials entry from mobile (link to /dashboard/materials instead)  
‚ùå Push notifications for new assignments  
‚ùå GPS-based auto check-in (geo-fence)  
‚ùå Photo attachments on check-in/out  
‚ùå Signature capture for job completion  
‚ùå Sync conflict resolution UI

## Next Steps After Completion

1. Test on real mobile devices (iOS and Android)
2. Test offline mode thoroughly (airplane mode)
3. Verify Google Maps navigation works
4. Test with various screen sizes (320px to 768px)
5. Seed test data with assignments for today
6. Complete manual testing checklist
7. Document mobile usage in user guide
