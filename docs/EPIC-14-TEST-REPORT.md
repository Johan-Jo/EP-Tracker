### 4. API Routes ✅

#### 4.1 Search API ✅
**File:** `app/api/super-admin/search/route.ts`

**✅ Functionality:**
- Requires super admin authentication ✅
- Searches organizations by name ✅
- Searches users by name and email ✅
- Uses admin client for RLS bypass ✅
- Deduplicates results ✅
- Limits to 10 results ✅
- Returns structured SearchResult array ✅

**✅ Query Parameters:**
- `q` - search query (min 2 chars) ✅

**✅ Response Format:**
```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "type": "user" | "organization",
      "id": "string",
      "title": "string",
      "subtitle": "string",
      "status": "string" (optional)
    }
  ]
}
```

**✅ Error Handling:**
- Returns empty array for queries < 2 chars ✅
- Handles Supabase errors gracefully ✅
- Returns 500 on server errors ✅

---

#### 4.2 Users API ✅
**File:** `app/api/super-admin/users/route.ts`

**✅ Functionality:**
- Requires super admin authentication ✅
- Fetches all users with organization members ✅
- Filters by search query (name/email) ✅
- Filters by organization ID ✅
- Filters by role ✅
- Gets last activity from time_entries ✅
- Returns detailed user data ✅

**✅ Query Parameters:**
- `search` - search query (optional) ✅
- `organization_id` - filter by org (optional) ✅
- `role` - filter by role (optional) ✅

**✅ Response Format:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "string",
      "email": "string",
      "full_name": "string",
      "created_at": "string",
      "last_activity": "string | null",
      "organization_members": [...]
    }
  ]
}
```

**⚠️ Note:** This API route queries `users` table which may not exist in Phase 1 schema. The page currently bypasses this by using `createAdminClient()` directly in the server component, which is the correct approach.

### 📝 Observations

1. **Search Input in Users Page**
   - Currently UI-only, not functional
   - Could be enhanced to filter table results
   - Low priority for now

2. **Users API Route**
   - Exists but not used (page fetches directly)
   - Could be useful for future client-side filtering
   - Keep for now, no action needed

3. **Support Actions**
   - Some functions are placeholders (e.g., `grantTemporaryStorage`)
   - Clearly documented and logged
   - Will need DB schema updates for full implementation

4. **Z-Index Fix**
   - Dialog overlay and content z-index correctly set
   - Fixes previous issue with backdrop covering modal
