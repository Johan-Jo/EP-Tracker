# Planning System - Implementation Overview

**Date:** October 23, 2025  
**Approach:** Structured EPIC-based development  
**Status:** ✅ Implementation Complete

---

## What is the Planning System?

The Planning System is a comprehensive week planner and resource management tool for EP Tracker that enables:

- **Visual week planning** with drag-capable grid interface
- **Resource management** with availability tracking
- **Conflict detection** for scheduling overlaps and absences
- **Capacity monitoring** to ensure adequate staffing
- **Mobile check-in/out** for field workers
- **Offline support** for disconnected work environments

---

## Implementation Approach

### ❌ Previous Approach (Rejected)

Initially, the planning system was implemented in a **single unstructured batch**:
- All features built simultaneously
- No clear milestones or acceptance criteria
- Difficult to track progress
- Hard to test incrementally
- Mixed MVP and Phase 2 features

### ✅ Current Approach (Structured EPICs)

The system has been **restructured into 3 focused EPICs** following the project's established methodology:

#### **EPIC 22: Planning Foundation**
- Database schema and migrations
- API routes for data access
- TypeScript types and Zod validation
- Conflict detection utilities
- **Deliverable:** Solid backend foundation

#### **EPIC 23: Planning UI**
- Week grid view components
- Assignment management dialogs
- Conflict handling UI
- Capacity indicators
- **Deliverable:** Complete web interface for planners

#### **EPIC 24: Mobile Today**
- Mobile job cards
- Check-in/out functionality
- Offline queue support
- Google Maps integration
- **Deliverable:** Field worker mobile experience

## EPIC Structure

Each EPIC follows this format:

### 1. User Stories with Acceptance Criteria
Clear Gherkin-style acceptance criteria for each feature:

```gherkin
Given [context]
When [action]
Then [expected result]
And [additional expectations]
```

### 2. Detailed Task Lists
Checkbox lists organized by component/feature area:
- Database tasks
- API route tasks
- Component tasks
- Integration tasks

### 3. Testing Requirements
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- E2E tests (Playwright)
- Manual testing checklists

### 4. Files Delivered
Complete list of files created/modified with line counts

### 5. Success Criteria
Measurable outcomes to verify completion

### 6. Dependencies
What's needed before starting and what this enables

## Why This Structure Matters

### Benefits

1. **Clear Milestones**
   - Each EPIC is a deployable unit
   - Can test and validate incrementally
   - Easy to track progress (EPIC 22 = 33%, EPIC 23 = 67%, EPIC 24 = 100%)

2. **Better Testing**
   - Foundation (EPIC 22) tested before UI built
   - UI (EPIC 23) tested before mobile features
   - Issues caught early in each layer

3. **Flexible Development**
   - Can pause between EPICs
   - Can pivot if requirements change
   - Can assign different EPICs to different developers

4. **Clearer Communication**
   - Stakeholders understand "EPIC 23 is complete"
   - Product owner can prioritize EPICs
   - QA team knows what to test per EPIC

5. **Maintainability**
   - Each EPIC documented independently
   - Future developers understand the progression
   - Easy to reference specific features

## What Was Built

### EPIC 22 Deliverables ✅

**Database:**
- `assignments` table (work assignments)
- `absences` table (vacation, sick, training)
- `shift_templates` table (reusable shifts)
- `mobile_notes` table (field worker instructions)
- Extended `projects` table (color, capacity)

**API Routes:**
- `/api/planning` - Week data
- `/api/assignments` - CRUD with conflict detection
- `/api/absences` - Absence management
- `/api/mobile/today` - Today's jobs
- `/api/mobile/checkins` - Check-in/out

**Types & Validation:**
- Complete Zod schemas
- TypeScript types with relations
- Swedish error messages

### EPIC 23 Deliverables ✅

**Components:**
- `PersonRow` - Resource list items
- `CapacityIndicator` - Staffing bars
- `AssignmentCard` - Job cards
- `ProjectChips` - Filter chips
- `AddAssignmentDialog` - Create/edit form
- `ConflictBanner` - Conflict warnings
- `WeekScheduleView` - Main grid
- `PlanningPageClient` - Data integration

**Features:**
- Week grid (Mon-Sun columns)
- Resource status tracking
- Project filtering
- Conflict detection with override
- Capacity monitoring

### EPIC 24 Deliverables ✅

**Components:**
- `MobileJobCard` - Mobile job display
- `MobileTodayScreen` - Today list

**Features:**
- Today's assignments list
- Check-in/out buttons
- Status updates
- Google Maps navigation
- Offline queue support

## Known Limitations (Out of Scope)

These were **intentionally excluded from MVP** to ship faster:

1. ❌ **Drag-and-drop** - @dnd-kit installed but not integrated
   - Currently: Click cell to create assignment
   - Future: Drag projects or assignments to new slots

2. ❌ **Absence visual overlay** - No red overlay on grid
   - Currently: Absences block via API only
   - Future: Visual red cells for absent users

3. ❌ **Absence management UI** - No create absence dialog
   - Currently: Absences created via API/SQL
   - Future: Dialog to create/edit absences

4. ❌ **Multi-select users** - Single-select dropdown only
   - Currently: Create one user at a time (or code multi-assign)
   - Future: Checkbox multi-select component

5. ❌ **Grid virtualization** - No virtualization
   - Currently: Handles <100 users fine
   - Future: Needed for 200+ user organizations

All of these are **documented as Phase 2 enhancements** in each EPIC doc.
