# EPIC 27: Voice Notes Implementation - Complete

**Status:** ✅ Deployed to Production  
**Date:** 2025-10-29  
**Implementation Time:** ~4 hours

## Overview

Successfully implemented voice recording functionality for diary entries with real-time audio visualization, automatic transcription via Whisper API, and translation to Swedish via GPT-4o.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Voice Recording UI
- **Location:** Diary entry form (`components/diary/diary-form-new.tsx`)
- **Trigger:** "Röstanteckning" button with microphone icon
- **Dialog:** Clean, modal interface for recording

### 2. Real-Time Audio Visualization
- **Component:** `components/voice/voice-recorder.tsx`
- **Technology:** Web Audio API with AnalyserNode
- **Features:**
  - 20-bar frequency spectrum analyzer
  - Real-time response to speech (not fake animations)
  - Red bars when speaking, gray bars when silent
  - Smooth 75ms transitions
  - Live recording timer (MM:SS format)

### 3. Recording States & UX
- **Idle:** Microphone button with instructions
- **Recording:** 
  - Stop button (red, square icon)
  - Live audio bars reacting to voice
  - Real-time duration counter
  - "Prata in ditt meddelande" prompt
- **Uploading/Processing:**
  - Loading spinner
  - "Nu gör vi om ditt röstmeddelande till text..." status
  - No descriptive text (cleaner UI)
- **Complete:** Auto-close dialog, text inserted into "Utfört arbete" field

### 4. Backend Integration
- **Upload API:** `app/api/voice/upload/route.ts`
  - Handles audio file upload to Supabase Storage
  - Creates session metadata
- **Stream API:** `app/api/voice/stream/route.ts`
  - Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time feedback
  - Whisper API transcription
  - GPT-4o translation (with construction glossary)
  - Language detection and ISO 639-1 code mapping
  - Saves to `voice_logs` table

### 5. Database Schema
- **Table:** `voice_logs`
  - `organization_id`, `user_id` (auth)
  - `audio_url` (storage path)
  - `original_lang`, `detected_lang` (ISO 639-1 codes)
  - `original_text`, `translated_sv`
  - `asr_provider` ('whisper-1'), `translation_provider` ('gpt-4o')
  - `segments` (JSONB - detailed transcription)
- **Storage:** `voice-recordings` bucket with RLS policies
- **Integration:** Extended `diary_entries` with voice metadata

### 6. Audio Format Handling
- **Priority:** audio/mp4 (best Whisper compatibility)
- **Fallbacks:** audio/webm, audio/ogg
- **Validation:** Proper file extensions and MIME types
- **Processing:** Automatic format detection and conversion

### 7. Language Support
- **Input:** Any language supported by Whisper API
- **Output:** Automatic translation to Swedish
- **Mapping:** Full language names → ISO codes (e.g., "english" → "en")
- **Supported:** en, sv, pl, de, es, fr, it, pt, ru, ar, zh, and more

- `lib/storage/voice-storage.ts` - Supabase Storage helpers
- `lib/db/voice-logs.ts` - Database queries

### Database
- `supabase/migrations/20251029000001_voice_notes_foundation.sql` - Schema
- `supabase/migrations/20251029000002_fix_storage_policies.sql` - RLS policies

## Key Fixes Applied

### Audio Visualization
- ❌ Initial: Fake sine wave animation (not synchronized with speech)
- ✅ Final: Real frequency analysis using Web Audio API AnalyserNode
- ✅ 20 bars representing actual frequency spectrum
- ✅ Direct response to voice input

### Recording State Management
- ✅ Fixed timer/VAD interval cleanup (useEffect dependencies)
- ✅ Single action button per state (no duplicate buttons)
- ✅ Proper dialog close handling with state reset

### Database Schema Alignment
- ✅ Language code mapping (full names → ISO 639-1)
- ✅ Required fields: `translation_provider` always set
- ✅ Check constraint compliance: `valid_iso_lang`

### UI/UX Polish
- ✅ Removed progress bar (cleaner design)
- ✅ Removed duplicate success toasts
- ✅ Hide instructions during processing
- ✅ Added VisuallyHidden DialogTitle for accessibility
- ✅ Swedish UI text throughout

✅ Recording starts/stops correctly  
✅ Audio visualization responds to speech in real-time  
✅ Timer counts up during recording  
✅ Upload progress shows spinner  
✅ Transcription completes successfully  
✅ Translation to Swedish works (tested with English, Polish input)  
✅ Text appears in "Utfört arbete" field  
✅ Dialog closes automatically on success  
✅ X button cancels and resets recording  
✅ Multiple recordings in same session work  

### Browser Compatibility

## Environment Variables Required

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJ...
```

## Performance

- **Recording:** Near-instant start (<100ms)
- **Audio Analysis:** 60 FPS visualization (requestAnimationFrame)
- **Upload:** ~1-2s for 30s recording
- **Transcription:** ~2-4s via Whisper API
- **Translation:** ~1-2s via GPT-4o
- **Total:** ~4-8s from stop to text insertion

## Known Limitations

1. **Audio Format:** Best with audio/mp4, fallback to webm/ogg
2. **File Size:** No explicit limit, but recommend <5 minutes
3. **Language Detection:** Relies on Whisper accuracy
4. **Offline:** Recording works, but upload requires connection

## Future Enhancements (Not in Scope)

- [ ] Offline queue for recordings (IndexedDB)
- [ ] Edit transcription before inserting
- [ ] Multiple language output options
- [ ] Audio playback in diary entries
- [ ] Voice command parsing (e.g., "add 2 hours")

## Deployment Checklist
