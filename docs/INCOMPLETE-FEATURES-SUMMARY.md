# Incomplete Features from Completed EPICs

**Date:** 2025-10-19  
**Status:** Features planned but not yet implemented

---

## Overview

While EPICs 1-5 are marked as "complete," several advanced features from the original plan were intentionally deferred or simplified. This document tracks those features for potential future implementation.

## üéØ Recommendations

### High Priority (Should implement before EPIC 6)
1. **Duplicate Yesterday** (0.5 days) - High value, low effort
2. **Batch Edit Time** (1-2 days) - Very useful for corrections
3. **Batch Delete/Edit Materials** (1-2 days) - Common workflow need

### Medium Priority (Can wait until after EPIC 9)
1. **Split Crew Time** (1 day) - Nice to have for flexibility
2. **Daily Reminders** (2-3 days) - Improves compliance
3. **Offline Photo Queue** (2-3 days) - Better offline experience

### Low Priority (Phase 2 or later)
1. **Geo-Fence Map Picker** (2-3 days) - Explicitly Phase 2
2. **Forgot to Stop Detection** (1 day) - Edge case, can be manual
3. **Mobile Camera Capture** (1-2 days) - Current solution works
4. **Quick Entry Shortcuts** (3-5 days) - Nice to have, complex

## üö¶ Decision Points

### Option A: Continue to EPIC 6 Now
- **Pro:** Maintain momentum, complete all EPICs
- **Pro:** These features can be added later
- **Con:** Missing some useful productivity features

### Option B: Implement High-Priority Features First
- **Pro:** More polished UX before moving forward
- **Pro:** Only adds ~3 days total
- **Con:** Delays EPIC 6 start

### Option C: Cherry-Pick After EPIC 9
- **Pro:** Complete all EPICs first
- **Pro:** Re-evaluate priorities based on pilot feedback
- **Con:** May be harder to retrofit later

## üìù Notes

- **Offline Queue (EPIC 4):** Basic offline queue for time entries IS implemented
- **Photo Gallery:** Multiple photos per entry IS implemented (added during EPIC 5 fixes)
- **Edit Functionality:** Edit mode for materials, expenses, and time entries IS implemented
- **User Management:** Full invite/edit/deactivate IS implemented (completed today)

**Recommendation:** Proceed to EPIC 6 and defer these features to a "Polish & Enhancements" phase after EPIC 9 completion.

**Date Documented:** 2025-10-19  
**Next Review:** After EPIC 9 completion or pilot feedback
