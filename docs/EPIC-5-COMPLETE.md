## 🔍 Technical Details

### Photo Upload Flow

**Materials & Expenses:**
1. User selects file or captures photo
2. Client-side preview (FileReader)
3. On submit, upload to Supabase Storage:
   - Bucket: `receipts`
   - Path: `materials/{uuid}.{ext}` or `expenses/{uuid}.{ext}`
   - Get public URL
4. Save URL to database
5. Display thumbnail in list with click-to-expand

### Swedish Mileage Calculation

**Conversion:**
- Swedish "mil" = 10 km
- Skatteverket 2025 rate: 18.50 kr/mil
- Database stores rate_per_km_sek: 1.85 kr/km
- Auto-calculated: total_sek = km × rate_per_km_sek

**UI Display:**
- Input: km (with decimal)
- Show: "= X.X mil (svenska mil)"
- Total: Auto-calculated on form

### Database Calculations

**All entities have auto-calculated fields:**
- Materials: `total_sek = qty * unit_price_sek` (GENERATED ALWAYS AS)
- Expenses: Amount stored directly
- Mileage: `total_sek = km * rate_per_km_sek` (GENERATED ALWAYS AS)

### Permission Model

**Consistent across all entities:**
- **Workers:** Can only view/edit/delete own entries
- **Foremen:** Can view all org entries, edit/delete own
- **Admins:** Can view/edit/delete all org entries
- **Approved entries:** Only admins can edit/delete

### API Response Format

**List endpoints return:**
```json
{
  "materials": [...],  // or "expenses", "mileage"
}
```

**Create/Update endpoints return:**
```json
{
  "material": {...}  // Single entity with relations
}
```
