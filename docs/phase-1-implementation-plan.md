- [ ] Admin can review, approve, and export salary CSV + invoice CSV without re-typing
- [ ] Offline mode works: create time entry offline → reconnect → syncs successfully
- [ ] All forms validate properly with Swedish error messages
- [ ] PWA installs on iOS/Android and shows on home screen
- [ ] Time-to-value < 15 minutes (signup → first approved timesheet)
- [ ] Zero data loss in crash scenarios (offline queue persists)
