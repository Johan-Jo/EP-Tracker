  organization_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES organizations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  role TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'worker' CHECK (role IN ('admin', 'manager', 'finance', 'worker')),
  joined_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
  UNIQUE(user_id, organization_id)
);
```

## 🎨 UI/UX Highlights

### Design System
- **Consistent Color Palette**:
  - Orange for admin roles and primary actions
  - Green for active status
  - Blue for trial status
  - Red for errors/suspended
  - Gray for inactive/neutral

### Animations
- Smooth modal transitions
- Hover effects on interactive elements
- Backdrop blur for modals
- Loading spinners for async operations

### Accessibility
- Keyboard shortcuts documented
- Focus management in modals
- Semantic HTML
- ARIA labels (ready to add)

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Server Components**: Used for data fetching (users page)
- **Client Components**: Used for interactivity (modals, search, table)
- **Service Role Client**: Bypasses RLS for super admin operations
- **API Routes**: RESTful endpoints for search and support actions

### Performance
- **Debounced Search**: Prevents excessive API calls
- **Lazy Loading**: Modal only renders when open
- **Optimistic Updates**: Ready for future implementation
- **Indexed Queries**: Proper database indexes for fast queries

### Security
- **Super Admin Check**: All routes protected by `requireSuperAdmin`
- **Service Role Key**: Secure storage in environment variables
- **RLS Bypass**: Only for super admin operations
- **Audit Logging**: Support action logging (ready to implement)

## 🧪 Testing Notes

### Manual Testing Completed ✅
- ✅ Users page loads and displays data correctly
- ✅ User detail modal opens on row click
- ✅ Global search opens with Cmd+K
- ✅ Search returns results for users and organizations
- ✅ Keyboard navigation works in search
- ✅ RLS policies allow super admin full access
- ✅ Service role client bypasses RLS correctly

### Edge Cases Handled
- Empty state when no users found
- Search with less than 2 characters

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### RLS & Security
1. **Infinite Recursion**: RLS policies that reference the same table they protect cause recursion
2. **Service Role Client**: Essential for super admin operations that need to bypass RLS
3. **Policy Simplicity**: Keep RLS policies simple; complex queries can cause performance issues

### Component Architecture
1. **Server + Client Split**: Use server components for data fetching, client for interactivity
2. **Prop Drilling**: Keep data flow simple; pass only necessary props
3. **State Management**: Local state is sufficient for most UI interactions

### Performance
1. **Debouncing**: Critical for search to prevent API spam
2. **Lazy Loading**: Modals should only render when needed
3. **Indexes**: Proper database indexes make a huge difference
