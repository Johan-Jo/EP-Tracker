- Sends magic link to user's email
- User clicks link to complete signup
- Redirects to `/dashboard` after signup

### Reactivation Logic
- If an invited email exists but is deactivated
- The membership is reactivated instead of creating a new one
- Role and hourly rate are updated
- New invitation email is sent

### Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)
- User activity log viewer
- Bulk user operations
- CSV import for multiple users
- Profile photo upload
- Custom email templates
