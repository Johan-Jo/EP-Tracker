4. Check which of these buckets exist:
   - [ ] `receipts`
   - [ ] `diary-photos`
   - [ ] `ata-photos`

### Step 3: Fix Code Bug

Fix the incorrect bucket name in `diary-form-new.tsx`:

```typescript
// Change from 'photos' to 'diary-photos'
const { error: uploadError } = await supabase.storage
  .from('diary-photos')  // ‚Üê Fix this
  .upload(filePath, photo);

const { data: { publicUrl } } = supabase.storage
  .from('diary-photos')  // ‚Üê Fix this
