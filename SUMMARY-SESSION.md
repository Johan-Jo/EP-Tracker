# 📋 Session Summary - Storage Buckets & Camera Capture

## 🎯 Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ Fixed "Bucket Not Found" Error in Dagbok
**Problem:** Users got "bucket not found" error when uploading photos in Dagbok (Diary)

**Root Cause:** 
- Missing `diary-photos` storage bucket in Supabase
- Code bug in `diary-form-new.tsx` using wrong bucket name (`photos` instead of `diary-photos`)

**Solution:**
- ✅ Created SQL script to create all 4 required storage buckets
- ✅ Created RLS policies for all buckets (16 policies total)
- ✅ Fixed code bug in `diary-form-new.tsx`
- ✅ Verified all buckets exist and have correct policies

### 2. ✅ Added Camera Capture Functionality
**Problem:** Photo upload areas didn't offer option to take photos with phone camera

**Solution:**
- ✅ Added `capture="environment"` attribute to 3 components:
  - `components/diary/diary-form.tsx`
  - `components/diary/diary-form-new.tsx`
  - `components/ata/ata-form.tsx`
- ✅ Updated UI text to: "Ta foto eller välj fil" (Take photo or choose file)
- ✅ Verified 3 other components already had camera support
