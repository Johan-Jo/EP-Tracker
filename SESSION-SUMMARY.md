# Session Summary - RLS Fix & Welcome Page

**Date:** October 23, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**

---

## 🎯 Issues Resolved

### 1. ❌ Circular RLS Dependency
**Problem:** The `memberships` table had a circular dependency:
- `user_orgs()` function queries `memberships` table
- Membership RLS policy uses `user_orgs()` function
- Result: Infinite loop preventing users from accessing their membership data

**Solution:** ✅ Created migration `20241024000002_fix_membership_rls_v2.sql`
- Drops ALL existing membership policies
- Creates "read own" policy FIRST (uses only `user_id = auth.uid()`)
- Creates "read org" policy for admin features
- Breaks the circular dependency by allowing users to read their own data without calling `user_orgs()`

### 2. ❌ Welcome Page Flow
**Problem:** Initially attempted to move welcome message into dashboard modal (bad UX)

**Solution:** ✅ Reverted to dedicated welcome page
- New users see beautiful `/welcome` page with role-based content
- Existing users go directly to dashboard
- Clean separation of concerns

### 3. ❌ Build Error
**Problem:** Next.js error about "next/headers" and plugin support

**Solution:** ✅ Removed duplicate `next.config.ts` file
- Had two config files: `next.config.ts` (empty) and `next.config.mjs` (actual)
- Next.js was confused about which to use
- Deleted the empty one, kept the real config

## ✅ What's Working Now

1. **Dev Server** - Running on http://localhost:3000
2. **Build** - No more Next.js errors
3. **RLS Policies** - Applied to database (user confirmed)
4. **Welcome Flow** - Dedicated page for new users
5. **Dashboard** - Direct access for existing users

## 🧪 Testing Status

**User reported:** ✅ SQL migration applied

**Next steps for user:**
1. Test new user signup flow (see `TESTING-WELCOME-FLOW.md`)
2. Verify no RLS errors in browser console
3. Confirm welcome page shows for new users
4. Confirm dashboard works for existing users

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### RLS Policy Order Matters
PostgreSQL evaluates RLS policies in order. By creating the "read own" policy first with a simple condition (`user_id = auth.uid()`), we ensure users can always read their own membership without triggering the `user_orgs()` function.

### Config File Precedence
Next.js reads config files in this order:
1. `next.config.ts`
2. `next.config.mjs`
3. `next.config.js`

Having multiple config files causes confusion. Stick to **one** config file.

### Server Components
In Next.js 15 with App Router:
- `next/headers` (cookies, headers) only works in Server Components
- Server Components are in the `app/` directory (not `pages/`)
- Our setup is correct; the error was due to config file conflict

## 📊 Database Schema

### Membership Policies (After Fix)

```sql
-- Policy 1: Read own membership (breaks circular dependency)
CREATE POLICY "Users can read own memberships"
    ON memberships FOR SELECT
    USING (user_id = auth.uid());

-- Policy 2: Read org memberships (for admin features)
CREATE POLICY "Users can read org memberships"
    ON memberships FOR SELECT
    USING (
        org_id IN (SELECT user_orgs())
        AND user_id != auth.uid()
    );

-- Policies 3-5: Admin management
-- (insert, update, delete with is_org_admin check)
```

**Why this works:**
- When a user queries their own membership, Policy 1 matches first
- Policy 1 doesn't call `user_orgs()`, so no circular dependency
- When `user_orgs()` is called (e.g., for admin features), it can now successfully query memberships because Policy 1 grants access

## 🚀 Production Readiness

### Before Deploying:

1. ✅ Apply migration to production database
2. ✅ Test signup/login flow in staging
3. ✅ Verify no console errors
4. ✅ Check all role-based content displays
5. ✅ Test with different user roles (admin, foreman, worker, finance)

### Migration Command for Production:

```bash
# Option 1: Supabase CLI
npx supabase db push --linked

# Option 2: Manual
# Copy SQL from: supabase/migrations/20241024000002_fix_membership_rls_v2.sql
# Paste in Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor → Run
```

## 🎯 Success Metrics

After deployment, verify:
- ✅ Zero RLS policy errors in logs
- ✅ Welcome page views for new signups
- ✅ Dashboard page views for returning users
- ✅ No increase in auth-related error rates
- ✅ Membership queries complete in < 100ms

---

## 📞 Support

If issues arise:

1. **RLS Errors:** Re-run verification script
   ```bash
   powershell scripts/verify-membership-rls.ps1
   ```

2. **Build Errors:** Check for duplicate config files
   ```bash
   Get-ChildItem next.config.*
   # Should only show: next.config.mjs
   ```

3. **Welcome Page Not Showing:** Check timing logic
   - Welcome only shows if membership created < 5 minutes ago
   - Test with brand new accounts
