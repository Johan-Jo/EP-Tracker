# üö® FIX: Photo Upload Bug - RLS Policy Error

**Error:** `Failed to upload photo: new row violates row-level security policy`

**Cause:** Storage bucket RLS policies are not configured

---

## üîß Quick Fix (5 minutes)

### Option 1: Via Supabase Dashboard (RECOMMENDED)

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard:**
   - Open: https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select your project

2. **Navigate to Storage:**
   - Click **Storage** in left sidebar
   - Click on **"receipts"** bucket
   - If bucket doesn't exist, click **"New bucket"**:
     - Name: `receipts`
     - Public: ‚úì Enable
     - Click **"Create bucket"**

3. **Configure RLS Policies:**
   - Click on **"receipts"** bucket
   - Go to **"Policies"** tab
   - Click **"New Policy"**
   
4. **Add These 4 Policies:**

#### Policy 1: Allow Upload (INSERT)
```
Policy name: Allow authenticated uploads
Allowed operation: INSERT
Target roles: authenticated
USING expression: (leave empty)
WITH CHECK expression: bucket_id = 'receipts'
```
**OR use SQL:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated uploads"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'receipts');
```

#### Policy 2: Allow Update
```
Policy name: Allow authenticated updates
Allowed operation: UPDATE
Target roles: authenticated
USING expression: bucket_id = 'receipts'
```
**OR use SQL:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated updates"
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'receipts');
```

#### Policy 3: Allow Delete
```
Policy name: Allow authenticated deletes
Allowed operation: DELETE
Target roles: authenticated
USING expression: bucket_id = 'receipts'
```
**OR use SQL:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated deletes"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'receipts');
```

#### Policy 4: Allow Public Read (SELECT)
```
Policy name: Allow public read
Allowed operation: SELECT
Target roles: public
USING expression: bucket_id = 'receipts'
```
**OR use SQL:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Allow public read"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'receipts');
```

5. **Verify:**
   - Click **"Review"** ‚Üí **"Save policy"** for each
   - You should see 4 policies listed

### Option 2: Via SQL Editor (FASTER)

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor**

2. **Run this SQL:**

```sql
-- Create receipts bucket (if doesn't exist)
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public)
VALUES ('receipts', 'receipts', true)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET public = true;

-- Drop old policies (if any)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated uploads" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated updates" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated deletes" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public read" ON storage.objects;

-- Create new policies
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated uploads"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'receipts');

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated updates"
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'receipts');

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated deletes"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'receipts');

CREATE POLICY "Allow public read"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'receipts');
```

3. **Click "Run"**

4. **Expected result:** "Success. No rows returned"

## ‚úÖ Test the Fix

1. **Refresh the application** (F5)

2. **Try uploading a photo again:**
   - Navigate to: http://localhost:3001/dashboard/materials
   - Fill in the material form
   - Click **"üì∑ Ta foto/v√§lj"**
   - Select an image
   - Click **"Spara material"**

3. **Expected result:**
   - ‚úÖ Photo uploads successfully
   - ‚úÖ No error message
   - ‚úÖ Material appears in list with photo

---

## üîç Why This Happened

**Root Cause:**
- The `receipts` bucket was created in the database schema migration
- BUT Storage bucket RLS policies are separate from table RLS policies
- Storage policies must be explicitly configured for each bucket
- Without policies, ALL operations are denied by default

**What We Fixed:**
1. ‚úÖ Ensured bucket exists
2. ‚úÖ Made bucket public (so photos are viewable)
3. ‚úÖ Allowed authenticated users to upload (INSERT)
4. ‚úÖ Allowed authenticated users to update files
5. ‚úÖ Allowed authenticated users to delete files
6. ‚úÖ Allowed public to view files (SELECT)

---

## üéØ Prevention

**For future buckets (diary-photos, ata-photos):**
- Run the same SQL but change `'receipts'` to the new bucket name
- OR manually create policies via dashboard

**Example for diary-photos:**
```sql
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public)
VALUES ('diary-photos', 'diary-photos', true)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated uploads diary"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'diary-photos');

-- (repeat for UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT)
```

## üìä Verification Checklist

After applying the fix:

- [ ] Bucket **"receipts"** exists
- [ ] Bucket is **public** (checked)
- [ ] Policy: **Allow authenticated uploads** exists
- [ ] Policy: **Allow authenticated updates** exists  
- [ ] Policy: **Allow authenticated deletes** exists
- [ ] Policy: **Allow public read** exists
- [ ] Photo upload works in app
- [ ] Photo displays in list
- [ ] No console errors

---

## üêõ Still Not Working?

### Check Authentication:
```javascript
// In browser console (F12)
const supabase = createClient();
const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
console.log('User:', user);
// Should show user object, not null
```

### Check Bucket:
1. Go to Supabase ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí "receipts"
2. Try uploading a file manually via dashboard
3. If fails, check bucket settings:
   - ‚úì Public must be enabled
   - ‚úì File size limit: reasonable (e.g., 50MB)

### Check Browser Console:
```
F12 ‚Üí Console tab
Look for errors like:
- "User not authenticated"
- "Bucket not found"
- "Policy violation"
```

### Manual Test Upload:
```javascript
// In browser console
const supabase = createClient();
const file = new File(['test'], 'test.txt', { type: 'text/plain' });
const { data, error } = await supabase.storage
  .from('receipts')
  .upload('test/test.txt', file);
console.log('Upload result:', { data, error });
// Should show data, not error
```

## üìù Summary

**What:** Storage RLS policies missing  
**Why:** Buckets need explicit permission policies  
**Fix:** Add 4 RLS policies via SQL or dashboard  
**Time:** 5 minutes  
**Impact:** Critical - blocks all photo uploads

**Status after fix:** ‚úÖ Photo uploads working
