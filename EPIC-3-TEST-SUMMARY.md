## 🐛 Known Issues & Expected Behavior

### API Stubs
The following features show `console.log` instead of real API calls:
- ✅ Create/edit/delete phases
- ✅ Create/update/delete work orders
- ✅ Invite users (button disabled)

**This is expected** - API routes will be built in later iterations.

### ESLint Warnings (24 total)
- Unused imports in placeholder/stub files
- `console.log` statements in API stubs
- Some `any` types in form handlers

**This is acceptable** for EPIC 3 completion.

## 🎯 Success Criteria

EPIC 3 is considered complete if:
- ✅ All pages load without errors
- ✅ Navigation works on mobile and desktop
- ✅ Forms validate correctly
- ✅ TypeScript compiles with 0 errors
- ✅ Build succeeds
- ✅ UI matches design expectations
- ✅ Role-based access works

---

## 📊 Performance Check

Check browser console for:
- ❌ No React errors
- ❌ No unhandled promise rejections
- ⚠️ Console.logs expected from API stubs
- ❌ No network errors (except for stubbed APIs)

Check Network tab:
- Page loads should be < 2 seconds
- No 404 errors on routes
- Static assets load correctly

---

## 🚀 Ready for Production?

**Not yet!** EPIC 3 provides the UI foundation, but needs:
- API route implementations (phases, work orders)
- Error boundaries
- Loading states for async operations
- User invitation flow
- E2E tests (Playwright)

These will come in subsequent EPICs.

Once you've verified the manual checklist above, EPIC 3 is officially complete and we can move to EPIC 4!
